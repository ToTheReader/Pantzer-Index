Panzer Index digitisation plan

1. Scan pages 

2. OCR with FineReader

3. Verify low confidence characters

4. Make headings identified by finereader big and export as formatted text to Word

5. go through whole thing and
	a. consolidate printer blocks over a page break (the cont. headings)
	b. put a new line before every printer heading (i.e. between each printer block)
	c. do a general check for consistency
	d. delete big letter headings
	e. things to findall/replace: the low quotation mark with '.,'; the carat with A (see global change file for more)

6. Run sequence of regexes to split up the heirarchy into a python dictionary (see regex file)

7. Export python dictionary as xml, excel, or similar

8. Import into TTR database by cross referencing numbers. 



low conf characters
page 1, 54

page 2, 59

page 3, 55

page 4, 58

so could be around 11,000 low conf characters!
Might be able to reduce this with a higher res scan?
Most of these are the same letters though so can be handled with a findall/replace, but would still need to click through all of them

Took about 5 mins to do 1 page, so allow 2 days for 193
